Oh my gosh, just finished 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 The Woman in the Yard and I am like... what even was that? 😂 I mean, seriously, the plot twists had me all over the place. You know when you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 a   thinking it'll be chill—and then bam! You're questioning your whole existence lol.

I mean, don't get me wrong, it's not that it was terrible. It’s just... the lady spends half the   staring out the window, and I’m like, GIRL, just call the cops already! But she’s just there like, “Hmm, what’s going on? like she’s in some sort of trance. I guess I’d be zoning out too if my yard was full of suspicious folks doing suspicious things. But still! 😂

> And the dialogue... don't even get me started. It’s like, who talks like that? Clearly, the writers have never been in an awkward conversation because they nailed unrealistic convos 101. The main dude? I swear he changed personalities twice—and for what? It’s like every character had a secret but forgot to mention it.

Anyway, I guess it’s what you get into when you decide to 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   on a whim. There were some cool scenes, though! Like the tense moment when you think something’s finally gonna happen... and nada. That's the part where you just laugh because what else can you do?

console.log('Why did I even type this?');

I don’t know, maybe I’m just overthinking it. It was late, I’m tired, and I'm here typing away like a maniac. But all in all, it was a wild ride. Would I recommend it? Maybe—if you're into yelling at your screen and being confused half the time. You know what I mean? 😂 Let’s chat more later, I’m gonna crash now.
